Tvouan, wanders over great distances. Across vast feelds, over misty mountains and through moist muck. In order for him and his brother to survive he will have to hunt some food. Tvouan now begins to
set up traps throughout the land to catch some rabbits or mices. Todd rides on his sholders happely singing a song about their adventure.
